# TDD Strict Equal
In this exercise you will be using a test driven development (TDD) approach to implement a `strictEqual()` function. 
The `strictEqual()` function will work similiar to the way the `===` operator works but within a `strictEqual()` function. 

Examples

- `strictEqual(5, '5')` should return `false` 
- `strictEqual('a', 'a')` should return `true`

Instructions

- Create a branch called `answer`
- Creating your tests
- Committing your tests to your branch
- Write the code for your your `strictEqual` function until your tests pass
- Commit your working code. 
- Push your `answer` branch up to GitHub.
- Create a pull request
- Request review from the instructor
